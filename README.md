# dhrandy-2023-Stockish-Theme
I took the 2022 and 2023 stock theme and combined the elements I liked in both of them.  I also added a few things and changed out the gaming icons for ones that, to me, more matched the theme.

## Installation - *This only works with Garlic OS
*Only Works with Garlic OS 1.2.3

## Notes
By downloading this file you take all responsibility for messing up your Anbernic RG35XX.  I am not held responsible. I can't guarantee this works with all versions of Garlic OS. Be sure to backup your current them in the skin folder!  You don't need the CFW folder on the second SD card.

Garlic OS screenshots are saved in: CFW\retroarch\.retroarch\screenshots
